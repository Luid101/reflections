What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  It creates a .git folder that stores all future commits that you make. You need to create one in order to store new commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area is the zone in between the working directory and the repository. It allows the user to choose what he or she wants to commit before they commit it.
