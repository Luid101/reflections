When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  To avoid your work from getting lost if something happens to your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  So that you don't lose changes to something new that you are working on locally.
