When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  To avoid your work from getting lost if something happens to your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  So that you don't lose changes to something new that you are working on locally. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  A fork is a copy of another persons repository on the github server. A clone is a copy of another persons repository on your computer. A branch is a copy of a file or group of files in your repository.
  You would use a fork when you want to work on someone else's project and have it on github.
  You would use a clone when you want to copy someone's project into your computer.
  You would use a branch when you want to record the state of files at a point in time or edit files at that time without changing the main state of those files. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  Helps you keep track of changes made in the local directory with respect to the directory online.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  Having multiple people edit a repository would be harder because they cant all push to one place.  

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
  If you are working on an experimental feature you would want to make changes on a separate branch
